# PassMApp
A desktop app to help you memorise your passwords.

                **Passwords are hashed and salted and then stored into a database.**
I think this is a decent amount of security for a simple desktop application, but I welcome anyone who has a more secure way of storing the passwords. I think we would all benefit from that.

## Using the application
The application asks you to enter the domain of an account. Then you enter the password for it. And a second time for verification; then it is hashed and salted and stored in the database. 
Example: account = Gmail, password = hello.

## Practice Menu
The application shuffles the stored accounts and asks you to enter the password for it. It verifies and if it was the correct password as the one you recorded, it displays the actual password in plaintext. When you enter the correct password and only then can you see the plaintext password.
## Empty Files
The application has an option to delete all stored records and empty the database. This is the Empty Files Option. Click it to delete all data!

# INFORMATION
I am working on adding a feature where you receive email notifications if and only you lose 75% of the Practice lessons to rehearse YOUR OWN PASSWORD! Yeah. For security purposes and the thrill.
